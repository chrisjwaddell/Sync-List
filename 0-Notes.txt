To Do
* JSON frontend
* Read powershell book
- get for free
- read it fast

Works well with OneDrive, dropbox as a backup
Put on github
Look for similar things


I want files kept on OneDrive only

copy to a file and it uploads without syncing



Frontend page
Browse for file or folder
- options to zip, make inactive
- powershell "Compress-Archive input.txt output.zip"
If folder
- recursive option
Choose file type in a folder
- choose folder first, then a file type - maybe they type in file extension
- recursive option

Can the browser show browse that acccepts folder or file? 
On linux and windows browser?

Give it a file name
It detects if it's windows or linux or iOS
It asks if you want to do it linux or powershell

Then it tells you to schedule it in your OS to run when you want 

It saves a json file and a script file

to load previous backup, it needs a json file

If any file or folder that's in the list doesn't exist, it tells them at the start of the backup
- and how to fix it
- and/or say in the log, and/or in the email

It only recreates the script when something gets added


1) specific file - 2
2) file type - 4
- saves as <folder-filetype>.zip
3) specific folder - 4

1) zip
2) recursive


copy file
copy file, zip
copy file type
copy file type, zip
copy file type, recursive
copy file type, zip, recursive
copy folder
copy folder, recursive
copy folder, zip
copy folder, zip, recursive


ignore files
eg .git


Have a logging facility just like currently
backup file is where it's all stored
backup folder has backup scripts, backup .htm and .json and .log


Node.js is needed when altering the backup list
Once backup .ps1 files are created, you can run them manually or in a scheduler




Destination
It needs a folder to save to
This is a special record in the json file

At start of backup, if this directory doesn't exist, it says it at the start

To be able to run the script automatically and have the date in would be great, powershell can do that:
Get-Date -Format yyyymmdd

option to save in folder yyyymmdd or in other folder
Warning if it overwrites other files


powershell "Compress-Archive input.txt output.zip"
- powershell can zip like this
it uses 7zip a and 7zip a -r commands
Can it do all text files recursively in E:\PROGRAMMING

simple script

https://github.com/traschke/7z-backup



Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\SourceDir" -Recurse |  Move-Item -Destination "C:\Destination"


Test-Path
if (Test-Path C:\DockerVol\SelfCertSSL -PathType Container) {
   New-Item -Path "C:\DockerVol\" -Name "SelfCertSSL" -ItemType "directory"
}

Make a procedure list this:

70%


see if folder there in destination

There could be 5 different backups

last saved in json info
- if today, it rebuilds that file

Grab some powershell scripts







put backup.mdb on backup mdb
save marketing knt, marketing mdb, competition, what else?
- there is a batch file - 
-- P:\MasterFind\MARKETING\WEBSITE\BACKUP.bat
- do A/B testing at the same time

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUiprFtgdck
how easy is it to get up and running on another host? - maybe pay for a 2nd host
if I make changes on a site, how easy is it to transfer that stuff to another host?

i have a script already - C:\DATA\SuperiorPro\MARKETING\WEBSITE\Test\backup.bat

backup website manually
- run batch file but date needs to be put in
-- can i make that automatic?
- I don't need to upload to webserver so it almost can be automated
- run it in System Scheduler





Google Drive (G Drive)
https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive
- 15 Gb free
all of the space is shared among G Drive, Google Photos, and Gmail.
Only sync, no backup

OneDrive
5Gb free
Sync or backup
I might need Office 365





Put it on github

I can use a similar page for debugger
Can I run this if not hosted

Put this on github before debug, debug will be more popular

my weekly backup is good but it has bugs, I spend too much time fixing it
Link it to a db
I love the way it zips all my text files
try to get it running automatically
It writes to commands.bat, simple string stuff, you need 7zip installed
- settings - 7zip folder, but there is something that can do zip, that's linux I think


Something else other than Dropbox because the files need to be on your computer
OneDrive??

Dropbox, connect up to it
and Google Documents connect up to
Google is $25/yr for 10Gb


Firebase documents
